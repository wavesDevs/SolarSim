# SolarSim
A Python based simulation of the solar system.

## Technologies
- Python
- Skyfield
- Pygame
- NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Ephemeris: de421.bsp

## Roadmap

### Completed Features
- load and store real planetary positional data from ephemeris
- create working pygame environment
- create dictionary containing celestial bodies to be simmed
- import current date and time information as UTC for historical reference point
- implement simulation loop to iterate over dataset range from current date to 2050
- retrieve positional data and update planets positions
- create labels and trails for visual representation

### To-Do List
- add moons and asteroid belt
- implement robust 3D visualization
- add zoom in/out, rotate, and drag functionality
